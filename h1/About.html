                Hi, my name is Yllza Gashi.
                 I study Computer Science at the Faculty of computer Science and computer engineering.

                I am an ambitious, confident, enthusiastic, friendly, honest and organised person. My strengths are always saying ‘yes’ and going out of my way to help,
                 leading a systematic life, a good planner, and infinite patience. My weaknesses are unfortunately my inability to say ‘no’, wanting everything to be absolutely perfect and getting carried away by people. 
            
                </p>

                Creativity in cooking for me is presentation of food in its simplest form and garnishing it. If people applaud it, then I think the purpose is achieved. Cleanliness in cooking is also creative work. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Cooking, eating healthy food and staying active have always been my life-long passion and – indeed – way of life. My food is simple, tasty and nutritious.
            </p>
